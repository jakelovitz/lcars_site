        description: `Some of my oldest memories are being in the VHS section of my local library, trying to remember which tape I wanted to grab based on it's cover image. Unfortunately for me, in this release the powers that be used Yoda's image on the tape for Episode VI, not V, despite him primarily appearing in the former. Despite the frequent mix-ups of a pre-literate youth (ironically in a library), the franchise as a whole and this installment in particularly have remained very, very dear to me.`,

Disappointingly, my parents accompanied this with Super Mario Bros, but luckily another well-wishing relative rectified that with the only other cartridge that Gameboy would ever know: Pokémon Red.
