                        My continuing mission: to pioneer unparalleled quality in digital products; to design and develop test suites comprehensive in their scope, depth, and supporting documentation; to boldly ensure consistency and confidence like never before.

                      I'm my mind, I'm a Code Integrity Officer, though in my near ten years of ensuring software products best meet the needs of its end users I've held such titles as Software Tester, Software (Development) Engineer in Test, and Quality Assurance Engineer.

                    <p>
                      Irrespective of the name of the role, I help software teams in their pursuit of that most elusive of goals, quality, through the noble and maligned art of testing.

                  When not chasing down abstract notions in abstract places I try to keep things a little more real. To me, this primarily entails reading books, learning new things (or rather, trying to), and doing my damndest to live the good life. If you want to learn a more about what I'm all about I've taken the liberty of cataloguing some of my favorite things. I even riff a little bit on the 'why' behind these selections.

                        "Since you went to all the trouble of waking me up, you must really, really love to test." - GLaDOS

                      I really did love testing the Aperture Science Handheld Portal Device with GlaDOS circa 2008-2011. Nowadays (circa 2015 - present day), however, I've shifted to my focus from portals* to protocols**, primarily within that one final frontier of Software applications: the Electronic Health Record.

                  Had you told me that any time prior to 2015, I would have asked "...what precisely does 'testing software' entail? How is that a full time gig?"
                </p>
                <p>
                  Here's how Glenford J. Myers, Tom Badgett, and Corey Sandler define the process of software testing in their in-depth and aptly named The Art of Software Testing, Third Edition:
                </p>
                <blockquote>
                  Testing is the process of executing a program with the intent of finding errors
                </blockquote>
                <p>
                  That's a quick and concise definition, which Myers et al. define on page 6 and spend most the rest of the book probing the implications of. In Cem Kaner, Jams Bach, and Bret Pettichord have a slightly different take, which they lay out in Indispensable Lessons Learned in Software Testing, a Context-Driven Approach:
                </p>
                <blockquote>
                  Testing is done to find the right information
                </blockquote>
                <p>
                  I like how Myers et al. describe the process, but prefer Kaner et al.'s description of our purpose. Thus my definition of (software) testing:
                </p>
                <blockquote>
                  Testing is the process of executing a program with the intent of finding the right information.
                </blockquote>
                <p>
                  Which is all very well and good, but still begs the question of how, exactly, one goes about doing that. Well, unlike the basics of the 2008 video game Portal, and it's 2011 successor, it turns out that software testing is quite like software development - it's actually a pretty deep field
